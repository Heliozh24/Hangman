A recreation of the classic hangman game.
One player inserts a word that has to be guessed and the other player tries to guess the word.
This game also works with a score system.
Extra ability to guess randomly characters of the word that has to be given, this however brings you closer to loss.

HOW TO RUN: go to cmd in the same file directory as the two .java files are and type (YOU MUST HAVE THE JAVA SDK INSTALLED IN YOUR PC):
  javac GameLogic.java
  javac HangmanGame.java
  java HangmanGame

This game was made by Helio Zhuleku on April 2025 using the Java Programming Language.
